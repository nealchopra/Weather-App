This weather app utilizes the OpenWeather API to provide users with real-time weather data for their location. Developed in Swift, it features current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. To optimize the weather data fetching and display process, the app implements advanced caching strategies and asynchronous networking for real-time data streaming and processing. It also implements a reactive programming paradigm for a responsive and dynamic user interface. The interface is designed using simple data visualization for intuitive weather display.
